## Benjamin MacLeod's Personal Website

My name is Benjamin MacLeod, and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration degree at Acadia University. Some of my hobbies include video editing, photography, and writing.

This website is a personal project of mine that I started in January 2025. Over time, I plan on using this site for a variety of things.
